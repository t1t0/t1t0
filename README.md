**t1t0/t1t0** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->
Full Stack Developer | Backend Enthusiast | PHP & JavaScript Specialist

Iâ€™m a Full Stack Developer who enjoys the whole stack but has a slight preference for the backend (PHP & Laravel, 
Node.js). I also know my way around the frontend with technologies like HTML, CSS, jQuery, Vue, and React.

Iâ€™ve built strong foundations in databases, working with both Relational (SQL, MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB) systems. 
Iâ€™m comfortable with Linux system administration and Iâ€™m always diving deeper into AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines with 
tools like GitHub Actions. Oh, and Iâ€™m also familiar with the joys (and headaches) of migrating between PHP and Node.js.

Experience Highlights:

	â€¢ I contributed to a universityâ€™s Library Management System and Student Information System using Laravel, Bootstrap, jQuery, and MySQL.
	â€¢ Played a key role in building and maintaining internal software for a startup.
	â€¢ Recently consulted for another startup, offering fresh perspectives and solutions to tackle their tech challenges.
	â€¢ After years in IT, I transitioned into full-time development five years agoâ€”best decision ever!

My Current Stack:

Laravel + TailwindCSS + VueJS (also Livewire or React depending on the project).

	â€¢	ðŸ”­ Actively working on honing my skills and expanding my stack.
	â€¢	ðŸŒ± Learning design patterns and mastering SOLID principles.
	â€¢	ðŸ‘¯ Open to collaborations on Open Source Projects.
	â€¢	ðŸ’¬ Ask me anythingâ€”Iâ€™m always happy to help.
	â€¢	ðŸ“« Feel free to reach out:
	â€¢	âš¡ Fluent in Spanish (native) and English (advanced)

 Titles I proudly wear:

Laravel Evangelist, PHP Lover, and JavaScript Enthusiast.
